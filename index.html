            My name is Gabrijela Gavric, and thanks to the instruction of Epicodus, I have learned to create a basic webpage.
            But before I showcase all that I have learned thus far, there are some things you should know!

          <h3>My Roots</h3>
          <p>
          I was born in former <strong>Yugoslavia</strong> towards the end of their cival war, but soon fled for safety and a better life here in the U.S.
          I am the second child of two wonderful parents, Ilija and Snjezana Gavric and a younger sister to an experienced
          graphic designer. <em>Look at some his great work <a href="http://www.bojangavric.com/">here</a>.</em>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3>For Fun</h3>
        <p>
        I spend the majority of my free time outdoors; from daily adventures with my dog, scuba diving adventures with friends,
        to skiing withy father or picking fruit with my mother. You name it, I'm into it.
      </p>

       <h3>Why I Enrolled at Epicodus</h3>
       <p>
       I decided to sign up for the Introductory Class to see if this was something I would enjoy as a carreer, and
       thus far my journey has been exciting and intriguing! I have no prior experience with computers, so this has
       been a great learning oppertunity.
