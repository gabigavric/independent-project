    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      My name is Gabrijela Gavric, and thanks to the instruction of Epicodus, I have learned to create a basic webpage.<br>

      But before I showcase all that I have learned thus far, there are some thins you should know!
    </p>

    <div class="column">
    <h3>My Roots</h3>
    <p>
      I was born in former <strong>Yugoslavia</strong> towards the end of their cival war, but sooen fled for safety and a better life.
      I am the second child of two wonderful parents, Ilija and Snjezana Gavric and a younger sister to an experienced
      graphic designer. <em>Look at some his great work here</em> (http://www.bojangavric.com/)
    </p>
    <h3>For Fun</h3>
    <p>
      I spend the majority of my free time outdoors; from daily adventures with my dog, scuba diving adventures with friends,
      to skiing withy father or picking fruit with my mother. You name it, I'm into it.
    </p>

    <h3>Why I Enrolled at Epicodus</h3>
    <p>
      I decided to sign up for the Introductory Class to see if this was something I would enjoy as a carreer, and
      thus far my journey has been exciting and intriguing! I have no prior experience with computers, so this has
      been a great learning oppertunity.
